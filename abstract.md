From Messy to Meaningful: Integrating Big Data in Palaeoecology

Large community databases such as Neotoma and PANGAEA have revolutionised palaeoecology by making data available at spatial, temporal, and taxonomic scales that were unthinkable only a decade ago. This wealth of information opens the door to exciting new questions about biodiversity, biogeography, and ecological change, but it also brings a familiar problem into sharper focus: palaeoecological data are messy. Counts, percentages, concentrations, metabarcoding outputs, and presence–absence records sit side by side, often based on inconsistent taxonomies, uneven sampling in time and space, and non-random site selection. While such inconsistencies are rarely a barrier in single-site studies, they quickly become problematic when we try to combine records across proxies or regions. Traditional multivariate methods, which have served palaeoecology well, are not designed to cope with this level of heterogeneity. Fortunately, recent advances in statistical ecology offer a way forward. Integrated and joint species distribution models, model-based ordination, copula methods, and network approaches provide flexible tools for drawing together disparate data types while accounting for effort, bias, and uncertainty. Ideas such as data fusion, change of support, and borrowing strength across datasets help tackle issues around diversity estimation, rare taxa, and misaligned records. To fully unlock the potential of palaeoecological big data, however, the field will need to embrace these newer frameworks and build closer links with quantitative ecologists. Doing so will allow us to make the most of the data already in hand and to shape how we collect and curate palaeo records in the future.
